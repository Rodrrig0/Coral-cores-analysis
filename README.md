# For what?
1) This code permit to study the coral skeleton variation, and compare them with satellite data (NOAA)
2) Method to analyse Sr/Ca ratio in the coral is in development ^^

# What do you need? 
In order to study coral skeleton, we used CT scanning method to visualise and estimate the density of coral cores. 


# Guide to proper operations
- Use the script make for analysis. 
- Import your core data in **data/CT/csv** in csv file.
- Please respect the structure of cores data (e.g. with GLOM2_a.csv) with the correct column names
- Regional satellite climate data can be import in the make script
